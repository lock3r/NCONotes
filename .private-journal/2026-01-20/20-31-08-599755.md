## Project Notes

NCONotes Session 1 - Project Setup (2026-01-20):

Completed initial project setup:
1. Initialized git repository and pushed to https://github.com/lock3r/NCONotes
2. Created README.md with basic project description
3. Added complete GPLv3 LICENSE file (verified it's complete at "END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS")
4. Installed Poetry for dependency management
5. Initialized Poetry project with:
   - Package name: nconotes
   - Python version: >=3.10,<3.15 (constrained for PySide6 compatibility)
   - License: GPL-3.0-or-later
   - Main dependency: PySide6 ^6.10.1
6. Created project structure:
   - src/nconotes/ - main package (not top-level to follow best practices)
     - __init__.py with version 0.1.0
     - __main__.py for entry point (allows `python -m nconotes`)
     - main.py with basic Qt window (NCONotesWindow class)
   - tests/ - test directory with __init__.py
7. Configured pyproject.toml with src layout: packages = [{include = "nconotes", from = "src"}]
8. Installed package in dev mode and verified it runs successfully (Qt window displays in WSL)

Tech stack confirmed:
- Poetry for dependency management
- PySide6 (official Qt binding, LGPL v3, fully GPLv3 compatible)
- Python 3.10+
- Src layout for clean package structure

Ready for next phase: implementing actual note-taking functionality.
