## Project Notes

Fixed two ResizableTextEdit bugs:

Bug 1 - Selection difficulty:
- Problem: Clicks went directly to QTextEdit, proxy widget never selected
- Solution: Added 3px subtle gray border (RGB 180,180,180)
- Border serves as selection target - clicks on border select widget
- Clicks inside text area still allow editing
- Override boundingRect() to include border space

Bug 2 - Resize handle not tracking:
- Problem: When resizing text_edit, bounding rect wasn't updating
- Handle position calculation used stale boundingRect()
- Solution: Call prepareGeometryChange() before setFixedSize()
- This notifies Qt to recalculate bounding rect
- Handle now tracks correctly during resize

Implementation notes:
- Border drawn in paint() using subWidgetRect()
- mousePressEvent checks if click is outside text_rect (on border)
- Border clicks set selected and allow movement
- Location: src/nconotes/main.py:31-140
