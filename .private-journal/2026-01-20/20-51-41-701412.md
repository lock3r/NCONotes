## Project Notes

Fixed double-click bug in NCONotes:
- Issue: mouseDoubleClickEvent in InfiniteCanvas was intercepting ALL double-clicks, including those inside text editors
- This prevented standard text selection (double-click to select word) from working
- Solution: Check if there's an item at the click position using scene.itemAt()
- If item exists, propagate event to it via super().mouseDoubleClickEvent(event)
- Only create new editor if clicking on empty canvas (item is None)
- Location: src/nconotes/main.py:266-287
