## Project Notes

NCONotes Integration Session (2026-01-20):

Successfully integrated OneNote-like prototype into NCONotes project:

1. Ported PyQt6 prototype (app.py) to PySide6:
   - Changed imports from PyQt6 to PySide6
   - Changed pyqtSignal to Signal
   - All other API calls remained identical between PyQt6 and PySide6

2. Integrated into main.py, replacing placeholder NCONotesWindow:
   - ResizableTextEdit: QGraphicsProxyWidget for text editors on canvas
   - ResizableImage: QGraphicsPixmapItem for images with resize handles
   - InfiniteCanvas: QGraphicsView with large scene (-10000 to 10000)
   - NCONotesWindow: Main window with toolbar, sidebar (notebooks/pages), and canvas

3. Features now available:
   - Double-click canvas to create resizable text editors
   - Drag and drop images onto canvas
   - Notebook/page organization (stored in ~/MyNotebooks)
   - Save/load functionality (JSON-based serialization)
   - Ctrl+Wheel zoom
   - Auto-save on page switch and close

4. Technical notes:
   - Uses QGraphicsScene/QGraphicsView architecture
   - Text boxes are QTextEdit widgets wrapped in QGraphicsProxyWidget
   - Images use QGraphicsPixmapItem with custom resize handles
   - All items support selection, movement, and resizing
   - Data stored as JSON files with notebook.json metadata and per-page JSON files

5. Removed app.py after integration (no longer needed)
