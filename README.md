# NCONotes

A mini project for managing notes.



TODO LIST:
- make this functional
- make EVERYTHING semantically searchable
- add doc/notes upload from structured files (e.g. pdfs, md, docx) with the ability to link to notes or projects or both (same doc linked to different projects would be huge)
- add possibility to tag stuff
